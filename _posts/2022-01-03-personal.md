New year, right?

I have spent a few weeks trying to reflect on things personally and professionally. Regarding the professional items I would like to complete this year, these are a few:

1. Changing location. Once again, kind of a nomada life at this point for me, having lived in 4 different countries as of yet, I will be, most likely, moving from Ireland to embark on a new location. The next country is yet to be decided, but I am grateful to have a few options on the table.
2. I will be working on my JNCIP-ENT certification, which I will be aiming to take no later than March 2022.
3. I will be working on my JNCIE-SP certification, which I will be aiming to take no later than September of 2022.
4. Create content here in this blog (monthly recurrence as usual), plus have more interactive content through other channels such as YouTube and/or Twitch.

There are other items I am working on, my hobbies (music, languages, travel, etc.), which I will be more serious about. I wish you an awesome 2022! :)

Well, that is all, folks. See you later, keep on growing.

Yay! :)
