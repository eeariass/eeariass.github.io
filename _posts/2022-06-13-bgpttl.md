Posting a document I wrote on `The Myth of the TTL in eBGP`, that covers the TTL in scenarios where routers are directly connected but peering is between their loopback addresses, [here is the document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iT8W7k2LLYo8Pep0DBZMR_aYi5vtL9B2PToX9o8CXG0/).

Hope it helps on your studies!
