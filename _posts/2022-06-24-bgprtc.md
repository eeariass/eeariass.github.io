Posting a document I wrote on `Route-Target Constraint (RTC): Scaling BGP with Constraint Prefix Distribution`, that covers the route-target constraint feature in BGP defined in RFC 4684. [Here is the document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZEk4gZEzWwFckJve5-R9bCfAifivWdD_mNz8hZUZtc4/).

Hope it helps on your studies!
