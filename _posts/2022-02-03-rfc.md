According to Wikipedia: Request for Comments (RFC) is a publication in a series, from the principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for the Internet, most prominently the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This is one of the prime matters from a knowledge perspective the networking area, as these contain what steps vendors should follow in oder to implement protocols and best practices in the networking industry. The comments are not really made in the 'RFC' themselves, but in the drafting process where withing a working group (WG) different engineers brainstorm and provide their perspective as to what a protocol should be, what problems should solve, terminology, compatibility with previous standards. First time I ever encountered an RFC was probably while in CompTIA course named 'IT Essentials', where private and public IP addressing was mentioned and RFC1918 was mentioned as the source. Since then, I have been reading this material as part of the main sources of preparation for different certifications. 

Besides existing 'serious' RFC's, there are some funny ones, too. Each April a new 'April fool's' RFC out, many exists, but the most famous is [RFC1925](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1925) titled 'The Twelve Networking Truths', every networking engineer should read this.

Have fun : ),
