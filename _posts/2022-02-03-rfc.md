Request for Comments (RFC) is a key element in the networking area, as we often find ourselves reading them and analysing what is the ideal behavior and/or what sort of behavior was originally intended for a particular protocol. It is a paramount resource while studying topics such as IGP, MPLS, BCP (Best Current Pratices). There are a few types of RFC's, some informational, some go pretty deep into diagraming the logic/flow intended in the algorithm of a protocol, but there are also funny ones.

Each April a new 'April fool's' RFC out, many exists, but the most famous is [RFC1925](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1925) titled 'The Twelve Networking Truths', every networking engineer should read this.

Have fun,
