In the last couple of months, been really into Junos studying for learning purposes and also trying to do their certification program for Service Provider Routing & Switching track. Recently passed the JNCIP-SP exam, which I have to say it took me longer than expected, due to the lack of a 'single source of truth'. Usually in my Cisco CCNP R&S days, I relied on the Cisco Press books, mainly the 'Foundation Learning Guides', for Juniper, my main source of study was the Juniper documentation directly, I did review User Guides (equivalent to the Configuration Guides in Cisco) for [almost] every technology/keyword listed in the exam. One thing I was particularly worried about was QoS, ironically it was the topic I got the highest score, others were OK-ish. As of now, have in target the JNCIE-SP exam, hoping I am able to at least do my first (and hopefully last) attempt at it.

This has been my first experience in a certification program outside Cisco, ever, and it has been smooth, exam questions are based on real-world scenarios and well crafted.

Will post new stuff here, in case I find something interesting during my JNCIE-SP studies.
