In this series of posts, I will be covering the configuration of RPKI and BGP Origin Validation (OV) in different network operating systems (NOS) such as: IOS-XE and Junos. For Junos, please refer to [Configuring RPKI and BGP Origin Validatiion in Junos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cmDQi2JYoKYcLUTcefsZH63ys8SQOz1kpoy1hKBrZVc/edit#)
