title: "Configuring RPKI and Origin Validation in IOS-XE" 
slug: rpki-xe
---

In this series of posts, I will be covering the configuration of RPKI and BGP Origin Validation (OV) in different network operating systems (NOS) such as: IOS-XE, IOS-XR, Junos, starting here with our beloved IOS-XE.

For the validator, I will be using the publicly available [GoRTR](https://github.com/cloudflare/gortr) docker image.

Note that this does not cover the fundamentals extensively. If you want an in-depth introduction to RPKI and Origin Validation, you can check an article I wrote for the Cisco Learning Network here, [BGP Security: Mitigating prefix hijacks with RPKI and Origin Validation ](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/blogs/a0D3i000008KX3IEAW/bgp-security-mitigating-bgp-prefix-hijacks-with-rpki-in-iosxr)

#### Topology is going to be fairly simple
<img src="/assets/images/rpki.png" alt="">

In this case, we are receiving the well-known prefix 8.8.8.0/24 prefix from isp2 AS #2, ideally all traffic should go through this path, but at some point, isp2 starts sending us the same prefix originated from autonomous system (AS) 666, which in this case is a shorter path, therefore it is chosen as the preferred route as seen below.

```python
customer#show bgp ipv4 unicast 8.8.8.0/24 best-path-reason
BGP routing table entry for 8.8.8.0/24, version 2
Paths: (2 available, best #2, table default)
  Not advertised to any peer

  	Origin incomplete, metric 0, localpref 100, valid, external
  	rx pathid: 0, tx pathid: 0
  	Updated on Jul 2 2022 14:38:16 IST
  	Best Path Evaluation: Longer AS path
  Refresh Epoch 1

	10.0.0.1 from 10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)
  	Origin IGP, localpref 100, valid, external, best
  	rx pathid: 0, tx pathid: 0x0
  	Updated on Jul 2 2022 14:37:06 IST
  	Best Path Evaluation: Overall best path <<< !
```


After this, we can observe that the routing table is using this path, even though this is a hijack from an attacker sitting behind isp2.


```python
customer#show ip route 8.8.8.0 255.255.255.0
Routing entry for 8.8.8.0/24
  Known via "bgp 100", distance 20, metric 0

  Routing Descriptor Blocks:

  	Route metric is 0, traffic share count is 1
  	AS Hops 2
  	Route tag 1
  	MPLS label: none
```


A few ways exist to solve this, some of them that can be mentioned include the use of prefix and regex filters, or what we will use here, Origin Validation (OV).

#### Setting up BGP OV
When an organization wants to use RPKI and OV, the Org in question will create a Route Origin Authorisation (ROA), these will contain the necessary information related to the Org, prefix, AS numbers cryptographically signed by an authority, e.g., a regional internet registry (RIR).

A validator would download this [publicly available] information from different repositories distributed across the globe. These ROA would be processed by a validator and a lightweight version of these would be sent to the edge routers using the RPKI to Router (RTR) protocol as Validated ROA Payload (VRP); these VRP are a lightweight version of the ROA.

Once the VRPs are downloaded in the router, the router would have the capability to identify the state of the prefix in the BGP table and the result would be flagged as valid**,** invalid**, **or unknown.

For this example, I will use the GoRTR validator, which is a free and publicly available project from CloudFlare.

#### Executing the GoRTR
```python
> docker run -ti -p 8083:8083 cloudflare/gortr -bind :8083
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested

INFO[0016] Updated added, new serial 0
INFO[0016] GoRTR Server started (sessionID:3316, refresh:3600, retry:600, expire:7200)
```

#### Enabling RTR in IOS-XE

A TCP session should be established between the validator and the router.
```python
bgp rpki server tcp 192.168.15.90 port 8083 refresh 300
```

The result is the session as per the output below.
```python

If we observe for any changes in the BGP IPv4 unicast table, we will see that the prefix 8.8.8.0/24 originated from AS 666 is being identified as **invalid**, while the origination from AS 15169 is being flagged as **valid**.

```python
customer#show bgp ipv4 unicast
BGP table version is 8, local router ID is 10.0.0.5
Status codes: s suppressed, d damped, h history, * valid, > best, i - internal,
          	r RIB-failure, S Stale, m multipath, b backup-path, f RT-Filter,
          	x best-external, a additional-path, c RIB-compressed,
          	t secondary path, L long-lived-stale,

 	Network      	Next Hop        	Metric LocPrf Weight Path

```

If we check the details of the prefix.

```python

```

By default, IOS-XE will locally not use prefixes flagged as rpki invalid, and therefore the legitimate origination coming from AS 15169 would be used, now the prefix from Google is in use even though the AS path length is longer.

```python
customer#show bgp ipv4 unicast 8.8.8.0/24 best-path-reason

#### Bonus Section

The first command allows us to disable the BGP OV as a whole by using the command ``bgp bestpath prefix-validate disable`` under the corresponding AFI. This is useful if you want the VRPs to be locally available in the router while disallowing the BGP bestpath algorithm from using OV for bestpath selection. This command is useful if we are in the initial stages of deploying OV and we still don’t want to start dropping invalid prefixes.

The second command is the ``bgp bestpath prefix-validate allow-invalid``. By default when BGP OV is enabled, the routers are not allowed to use invalid prefixes, therefore these would be present in the BGP table, but always unused. If isp2 in our example were to stop from advertising the legitimate prefix 8.8.8.0/24 originated from 15169, the alternate path would be available, but still flagged as invalid, BGP bestpath selection would never select this prefix for routing.

With the ``bgp bestpath prefix-validate allow-invalid`` command, we can enable bestpath selection on invalid prefixes so that they are used in case a valid or unknown advertisement is not available.

Only the advertisement coming from isp1 exists, which is flagged as invalid and not used for bestpath selection.

```python
customer#show bgp ipv4 unicast 8.8.8.0/24
BGP routing table entry for 8.8.8.0/24, version 3
Paths: (1 available, no best path) <<< ! no bestpath
  Not advertised to any peer
  Refresh Epoch 1

  	path 7FF0156EE068 RPKI State invalid <<<
  	rx pathid: 0, tx pathid: 0
  	Updated on Jul 2 2022 16:38:42 IST
```

#### Configuring bgp bestpath prefix-validate allow-invalid

```python
router bgp 100
 address-family ipv4 unicast
  bgp bestpath prefix-validate allow-invalid
```

Now we can observe that the prefix will be selected as bestpath even if it is flagged as invalid.

```python
customer#show bgp ipv4 unicast 8.8.8.0/24
