Well, it's elvin.

I [finally!] will start posting content (who cares?). I'd like to take a few words to share my interests and what would I be posting, it will be brief, one/two liners.

## Index <!-- omit in toc -->

- [Non-deterministic](#non-deterministic)

## Routing

Will try to add a few thoughts 'here and there' about routing/switching, and service provider technologies. Mainly things I have interesting.

## Non-deterministic

Some pseudo-random thoughts will be also posted. Random means 'non-networking' related. Possibly career oriented, or any other scope I feel sharing.
