Posting a document I wrote on `Understanding EIGRP Unequal-Cost Multipath (UCMP) Traffic Share Ratios`. This covers CEF, EIGRP Traffic-share balanced vs. traffic share min across-interfaces, Hash Bucket details, and how we can predict Traffic Share ratios based on metric manipulation, [here is the document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDscLm9PtBpgnfuaXU3LXgfaKfsBNZYnKsANCZqZabw/).

Hope it helps on your studies!
