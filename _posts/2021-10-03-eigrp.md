Posting a document I wrote on `Understanding EIGRP Unequal-Cost Multipath (UCMP) Traffic Share Ratios`. This covers CEF, EIGRP Traffic-share balanced vs. traffic share min across-interfaces, Hash Bucket details, and how we can predict Traffic Share ratios based on metric manipulation, [here is the document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HNo0gQnOMeMxTSHfeX44vumpE8lEw9-e/view).

Hope it helps on your studies!
