I re-worked an old document I wrote a few years ago named 'Understanding EIGRP Unequal-Cost Multipath (UCMP) Traffic Share Ratios'. It covers CEF, Hash Buckets, and how we can predict Traffic Share ratios based on metric manipulation.

[Here is the document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PgNACSRmKrhB5-CqZkDDqgTkiOlvZVjI/view?usp=sharing).

Hope it helps on your studies!
