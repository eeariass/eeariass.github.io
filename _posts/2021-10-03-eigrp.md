Posting a document I wrote on 'Understanding EIGRP Unequal-Cost Multipath (UCMP) and Traffic Share Ratios'. This covers CEF, EIGRP Traffic-share balanced vs. traffic share min across-interfaces, Hash Bucket details, and how we can predict Traffic Share ratios based on metric manipulation.

[Here is the document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M4LmXzFPabkVnkrtM_T-bbPYiibl5gul/view).

Hope it helps on your studies!
