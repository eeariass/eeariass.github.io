Posting a document I wrote on 'Understanding EIGRP Unequal-Cost Multipath (UCMP) Traffic Share Ratios'. This covers CEF, EIGRP Traffic-share balanced vs. traffic share min across-interfaces, Hash Bucket details, and how we can predict Traffic Share ratios based on metric manipulation.

[Here is the document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oAqB2z83r_6O4lZ4SoQg2DS0fSz3mspc/view).

Hope it helps on your studies!
