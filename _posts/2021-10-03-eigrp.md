Posting a document I wrote on `Understanding EIGRP Unequal-Cost Multipath (UCMP) Traffic Share Ratios`. This covers CEF, EIGRP Traffic-share balanced vs. traffic share min across-interfaces, Hash Bucket details, and how we can predict Traffic Share ratios based on metric manipulation, [here is the document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR7fEqT17vcWqgthKMlX2j7npkZiYmctN81Bf_S8JiV0M6hfKY8Tr8bqIBTWsqsfXo9s1nAo1AFEuWd/pub).

Hope it helps on your studies!
