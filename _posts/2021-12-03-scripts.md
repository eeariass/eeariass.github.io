Sharing a few scripts here that I have created based on the [https://bgpstuff.net](https://bgpstuff.net) portal, which is a great resource I often find myself using, therefore I did create some bash scritpts and use it frequently.

Scripts can be found here: [https://github.com/eeariass/Code/tree/main/scripts](https://github.com/eeariass/Code/tree/main/scripts).

Hope that helps you,
