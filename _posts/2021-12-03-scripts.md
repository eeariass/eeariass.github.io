Dropping some scripts here that I have created based on the https://bgpstuff.net portal, which is a great resource I often find myself using, therefore I did create some bash scritpts and use it frequently.

Scripts can be found here: https://github.com/eeariass/Code/tree/main/scripts.

Hope that helps you!
