Sharing a few scripts here that I have created based on the [bgpstuff.net](https://bgpstuff.net) portal, which is a great resource I often find myself using, therefore I made some scripts to quickly query some of the features it offers. What each script does is self-explanatory based on how it is named:

- roa: returns whether a prefix has a roa or not;
- rpki-invalids: returns whether a prefix is flagged as RPKI INVALID;
- bgptotals: tells you how many BGP prefixes currently exists in the internet;
- asn: returns the name of the ORG based on the ASN number;
- rfc: might be useless, but grabs the RFC number given and puts it in txt file;
- prefix-origin: tells you which ASN is originating the IP prefix;

Scripts can be found here: [scripts](https://github.com/eeariass/Code/tree/main/scripts).
