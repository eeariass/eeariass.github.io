`my $name = "Elvin"` and I am a network engineer. 

I will use this space to share some things I find interesting and/or put notes on things I am studying around networking. Please do not have high expectations, this space is called `null0.network` for a reason, this might be just things I drop here and might get lost forever violating the principles of the No-hiding theorem. :) 

If there is something technically wrong or that lacks context/accuracy, please reach out, my contact info is at the bottom of this page.
