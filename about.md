`my $name = "elvin";` and I am a network engineer - I love what I do. ; ) 

I will use this space to share some things I find interesting and/or put notes on things I am studying around networking. Please do not have high expectations, this space is called `null0.network` for a reason, this might be just things I drop here and might get lost forever violating the principles of the No-hiding theorem. :)

I will also share some personal thoughts here and there, these posts will be tagged as `personal#: description`, so that in case you don't want to read it, just skip those.

If there is something technically wrong or that lacks context/accuracy, please reach out, my contact info is at the bottom of this page.
