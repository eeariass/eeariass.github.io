`my $name = "elvin";` and this blog is a mix of professional and personal items I would like to share. 

I describe myself as a devoted learner and perpetually curious. Professionally I do network engineering for living, and I really love what I do for living. When learning something new, I like to focus on the fundamentals in order to understand the nature of what is being learned.

I will use this space to share some things I find interesting and/or put notes on things I am studying around networking. This space is called `null0` for a reason, this might be just things I drop here and might get lost forever violating the principles of the No-hiding theorem. :) I will also share some personal thoughts here and there.

Note: If there is something technically wrong or that lacks context/accuracy, please reach out, my contact info is at the bottom of this page.
