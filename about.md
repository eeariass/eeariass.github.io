`my $name = "elvin";` and this blog is a mix of professional and personal items I would like to share. 

I describe myself as a devoted learner and perpetually curious. Professionally I am a network engineer, and I really love what I do. I like to focus on the fundamentals of things, really aiming networking topics to become second nature, fundamental understanding is key to me. 

I will use this space to share some things I find interesting and/or put notes on things I am studying around networking. Please do not have high expectations, this space is called `null0.network` for a reason, this might be just things I drop here and might get lost forever violating the principles of the No-hiding theorem. :) I will also share some personal thoughts here and there, these posts will be tagged as `personal#: description`.

If there is something technically wrong or that lacks context/accuracy, please reach out, my contact info is at the bottom of this page.
